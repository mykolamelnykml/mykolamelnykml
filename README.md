Greetings! üëã 

My name is Mykola Melnyk, and I'm an ML expert with two decades of experience in the software development. I specialize in transforming *complex business ideas into scalable, secure, and efficient AI-driven products*. I have expert knowledge in various areas, enabling me to *deliver cutting-edge, top-tier AI solutions* that drive business growth and improve efficiency.

### Key Areas of My Specialization:

üìÑ **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** 5+ years of experience in document processing, understanding, and anonymization. Led the development of Spark OCR (Visual NLP) using technologies such as Python/Scala, PySpark, PyTorch, LLMs, LLama 3, Mini Gemini, LangChain, and Hugging Face Transformers.

‚ö° **Big Data Processing with Apache Spark:** 7+ years of experience designing and optimizing large-scale data pipelines for high-performance processing. In-depth knowledge of Spark internals, Spark Structured Streaming, and creator/contributor to the open-source spark-pdf datasource project written in Scala, enhancing Spark‚Äôs capabilities.

üîí **Data De-identification & Anonymization:** Expert in anonymizing sensitive data from text, images, PDFs, and DICOM files. I ensure privacy, security, and compliance with GDPR and HIPAA standards using NLP, OCR, and computer vision to remove or mask personal information, safeguarding data confidentiality.

üß¨ **Healthcare, Pharma, MedTech, BioTech Expertise:** Over 5 years of experience in the healthcare and life sciences sectors, with a strong understanding of formats like DICOM, and expertise in delivering solutions specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of these industries.

The project provides a custom data source for the Apache Spark that allows you to read PDF files into the Spark DataFrame.

### Key features:

- Read PDF documents to the Spark DataFrame
- Support read PDF files lazy per page
- Support big files, up to 10k pages
- Support scanned PDF files (call OCR)
- No need to install Tesseract OCR, it's included in the package
